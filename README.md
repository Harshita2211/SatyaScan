Real-time Detection of Fake News on Websites or Social Media using NLP and Fact-Check APIs

Problem Statement:-
The rapid spread of misinformation and fake news on websites and social media platforms poses a serious threat to public opinion, democratic processes, and public safety. Manual verification is time-consuming and ineffective against the scale of digital content being published every second.

Our Solution:-
We propose an intelligent, real-time system that detects and flags potentially fake news content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and external fact-check APIs. The user will enter the news into the system, analyze its credibility using API's and provides a confidence score and supporting evidence or rebuttals from verified sources.

Tech Stack:-
- Backend: Java (Servlets or Spring)
- NLP: OpenNLP / CoreNLP 
- APIs: Google Fact Check Tools API, Claimbuster API
- Frontend : HTML/CSS(or simple Java GUI)
- IDE/Editor: VS Code, Notepad++
- Deployment: Localhost via Apache Tomcat
